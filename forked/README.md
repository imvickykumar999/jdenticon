GitHub's identicons are generated using the [jdenticon](https://jdenticon.com/) library, which creates unique visual representations based on hashes (like a username hash). The shapes and colors are determined algorithmically.

### Shapes
The number of possible shapes is determined by:
1. **Grids**: Identicons typically use a 5x5 or 4x4 grid.
2. **Patterns**: Each cell in the grid can be one of several possible patterns or be empty.

### Colors
The color is typically derived from the hash, leading to a vast number of potential colors.

### Calculation Example
If using a 5x5 grid:
- Each cell can have one of `n` patterns (including an empty cell).
- For `n` patterns, there are \( n^{25} \) possible combinations for the grid.

### Colors
- Assuming the color is chosen from a 24-bit RGB palette, there are \( 2^{24} \) possible colors (over 16 million).

Thus, the total number of possible identicons can be immense, combining the variations in both shapes and colors. The exact number depends on the specific implementation details of the identicon generator.

```python
import hashlib
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

def generate_identicon(username, size=250, grid_size=5, save_path="identicon.png"):
    # Step 1: Hash the username
    hash = hashlib.md5(username.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    
    # Step 2: Determine the color
    color = tuple(int(hash[i:i+2], 16) for i in (0, 2, 4))
    
    # Step 3: Create the grid
    grid = []
    for i in range(0, 15, 3):
        grid.append([int(hash[i:i+1], 16) % 2, int(hash[i+1:i+2], 16) % 2, int(hash[i+2:i+3], 16) % 2])
    # Mirror the grid to ensure symmetry
    for row in grid:
        row.extend(row[:-1][::-1])
    
    # Step 4: Draw the identicon
    img = Image.new('RGB', (grid_size*size//5, grid_size*size//5), (255, 255, 255))
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    
    for y in range(grid_size):
        for x in range(grid_size):
            if grid[y][x]:
                draw.rectangle(
                    [x*size//5, y*size//5, (x+1)*size//5, (y+1)*size//5],
                    fill=color
                )
    
    img = img.resize((size, size), Image.NEAREST)
    img.save(save_path)
    print(f"Identicon saved to {save_path}")

# Example usage
generate_identicon("username", save_path="username_identicon.png")
```

### Explanation

1. **Hash the Input**: The `hashlib.md5` function creates a hash from the username.
2. **Determine Colors**: Extract the first three bytes of the hash for the RGB color.
3. **Create a Grid**: The grid is determined by the next few bytes of the hash.
4. **Draw the Identicon**: Use the Pillow library to draw the identicon based on the grid and color.
5. **Save the Image**: The `img.save(save_path)` function saves the generated identicon to the specified file path.

This code will generate and save the identicon image as "username_identicon.png". Adjust the `save_path` parameter as needed to save the image to a different file or location.

Hereâ€™s a visualization of how the identicon is constructed:
- Each cell in the grid is determined by a portion of the hash.
- The grid is mirrored to ensure symmetry.
- The identicon is drawn based on the grid pattern and the color derived from the hash.
